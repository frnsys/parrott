Under the Law of War we can hold #Boston suspect as a potential enemy combatant not entitled to Miranda warnings or appointment of counsel.
...criminal enterprise, but terrorists trying to injure, maim, and kill innocent Americans.#Boston
The accused perpetrators of these acts were not common criminals attempting to profit from a criminal enterprise....
It is clear events we have seen over the past few days in Boston were an attempt to kill American citizens &amp; terrorize a major American city
Just put out this statement with @SenJohnMcCain about #Boston suspect and #Miranda warning.  http://t.co/FZ4FKUb37w
I hope the Obama Administration will seriously consider this option. #Boston
The goal is to gather intelligence and protect our nation which is under threat from radical Islam. #Boston
The Law of War allows us to hold individual in this scenario as potential enemy combatant w/o Miranda warnings or appointment of counsel.
The least of my worries is a criminal trial which will likely be held years from now. #Boston
We should be focused on preventing possible attacks over the coming hours and days.  #Boston
It is vital he be questioned for intelligence gathering purposes about possible future plots. #Boston
Now that the suspect is in custody, the last thing I want is for him to remain silent. #Boston
I appreciate the hard work and bravery  of our law enforcement and intelligence communities. #Boston
@washpost Boston bombing is 'Exhibit 'A' of why the homeland is the battlefield http://t.co/ed7t0jjzOu
The Obama Administration needs to be contemplating these issues and should not rush into a bad decision.
The last thing we may want to do is read Boston suspect Miranda Rights telling him to "remain silent."
If the #Boston suspect has ties to overseas terror organizations he could be treasure trove of  information.
If captured, I hope Administration will at least consider holding the Boston suspect as enemy combatant for intelligence gathering purposes.

Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and first responders in Boston.
In 2010, over 13,000 fugitives failed a background check yet less than 15 people were successfully prosecuted.
We already have major holes in the current NICS system. Instead of expanding a broken background check system, let’s fix it.
I will oppose the Toomey-Manchin background check amendment. The proposal, while well-intentioned, is not a solution to illegal gun violence
I welcome a debate on gun control. The American people deserve to see where their elected representatives stand on the Second Amendment.
The gun control legislation can still be filibustered after today in the United States Senate.
My legislation, backed by the NRA, would make a real difference in keeping guns out of the wrong hands.
I have my own legislation, supported by the NRA, which I want to bring forward in the Senate.
Some politicians’ dream scenario is 1 where they don’t have to vote For / Against but can tell each side they were with them all along.
Nothing the Democrats are proposing would have prevented the Sandy Hook massacre.We need Senators on record, do you support these proposals?
Many Senators have refused to even take a position on some of these issues for fear of angering one side or the other. Make them vote!
I welcome a debate on the Second Amendment in the United States Senate. I want to proceed to this bill. I want to debate it. I'm not afraid.

Ready to try to solve the serious long-term budget problem our country faces &amp; can accept failure as an outcome. I cannot accept not trying.
I shared with my colleagues there is no dishonor in trying and failing to solve big problems.
The long-term budgetary problems we discussed last night have defied bipartisan solutions for far too long.
One thing I am certain of -- the perpetual campaign will not solve the nation’s problems.
The discussions with the President about our long-term budget problems were candid and differences in philosophy were apparent.
Hope it serves as the beginning of a new paradigm where people in elected office actually talk to each other about meaningful issues.
