Big news: we’ve assembled the HOLO Digital Gift Bundle for all $30+ donors: http://t.co/9VV3ZBM3 – a thank you gift for our backers.
@_fov As it stands we will be breaking even or even losing money for international shipping at many of our donation tiers.
@_fov Some context: HOLO will be almost 1kg. We have subsidized the shipping across our campaign to keep fees as low as possible.
@softwareandart Indeed, future ‘artist feature’ rosters will definitely be more diverse. (Note: contributor-wise we are much more balanced).
…and of course thanks to all that have supported us thus far!

@gravitron Tablet yes, with a bit of content published to @creativeapps. Re: tablet, see http://t.co/KOCw7DZg
@gravitron That’s not something on our ‘to do’ list – we’ve been paying contributors from day one. :)
I think @gravitron’s suggestion definitely goes on the ‘to investigate’ list. @dassagenhaben take note!
As we move beyond our funding goal we’re committed to reinvesting funds to experiment. Also like to commission some new artwork for HOLO 1.
Re: previous tweet. At moment much more likely that experimentation will come through inserts/multiple paper stocks within first issue.
It is a possibility. MT @gravitron: Wondering if HOLO will be printed on a digital press? Some opportunity for generative art/design…

@Pucknell Thanks Shawn, your support is appreciated!
@Zer0Her0 Our creative director @dassagenhaben will sort you out with an answer to your question.
@henkboom FYI –across our campaign the shipping is heavily subsidized, we’re basically breaking even on vast majority of the issues we ship.
@henkboom There is no granularity in Kickstarter. It is USA/International. Hope you see where we are coming from.
@henkboom Unfortunately, Canada becomes ‘international’ on USA Kickstarter. $15 is not ideal for Canada, necessary for Croatia.
@henkboom HOLO is not only a magazine but (will be) close to 1 kg w/ our current printing specs.
@henkboom We’ve tentatively selected a top-notch fulfilment company but are exploring options (looking for better deal).
@henkboom We’ll address shipping via an FAQ question soon. Believe it or not, it will cost more to ship within Canada than to the states.
Many thanks to these generous folks for helping us with our ‘hello world’ campaign. Consider this string of tweets HOLO’s first #FF.
Finally, we are super proud to have partnered with the amazing team at @GAFFTA for our campaign.

The Anatomy of a Misinformation Disaster by @alexismadrigal: http://t.co/oiJNkZCWxg
@GalSitty @md_charleston I actually noticed that last night, most news orgs slowed/controlled their breaking alerts compared to days prior
@GalSitty @md_charleston @reddit Yes, and @cnn is actually worse because its veiled by a sense, or expectation, of legitimacy.
@GalSitty @md_charleston Because @Reddit is enabling rapid dissemination of falsely incriminating info that also affects the investigation?
Appropriate reading, News is bad for you: http://t.co/WFtAg8yJN4

@drelly And now all I can think about is hadouken. Probably time for bed.
How does one pronounce Mnookin?
The weirdest effect of information traveling at this pace is the feeling that it's okay to stay up later or not do work just to keep up.
Journo vs. non-journo debate has already begun to rage, but what won't ever be the same is how fast information will travel sourced or not.
Our entire idea of information and credibility is collapsing in on itself at this very moment.

Not that comparisons are worthwhile here but that video changed intensified perspective of Boston in some way. The first-person effect.

@juliahartowitz @ztf ... really identified with that as my mode of support. It seems, I don't know, fleeting? Kind of easy? Shrug.
@juliahartowitz @ztf I think you're right, J. And I get that and realize I'm being a bit of a wet blanket about it all, I've just never...
@ztf It's like lawn signs and bumper stickers, I don't really get it. That's all. I'm lame like that.

@ztf @simplebracket And I agree with Zach!
@SimpleBracket @ztf That actually bumps up your cred. No one likes the first four, but it's real now.
@simplebracket @ztf Yeah, it's just the label of the first category.
@SimpleBracket @ztf Missing the round of 32, we don't go from round two to sweet sixteen.
Or I'm misunderstanding and it calculates correct picks in each round. Maybe its just the label of Second Round which should be round of 32.
The @simplebracket scorecard is lol wrong. The Sweet Sixteen does not have 16 games &amp; we are not currently in it. This is the round of 32.
The last 1% of an iPhone 5 battery lasts for longer than any other 10-20%...
@SimpleBracket Not sure if its related, but pools and scorecards seem to have finally updated but not pool leader boards
@studioneat I do not envy you guys today/this week. Good luck.
@studioneat I don't totally understand that constraint but we fixed it by time traveling to yesterday. So that's good.
Weird that @studioneat arbitrarily chose to lock brackets in Simple Bracket at 11am est but didn't make that at all clear in the app.

@MikeRoe Would also love if the brackets had names so I could discuss individual bracket competition.
@MikeRoe Would love to know if there are actual seeds, #1 vs #8 in each individual bracket, based on listenership or syndication, etc.
@MikeRoe I'm just curious how they were organized, would love if each bracket had a name, so I could discuss individual bracket competition
